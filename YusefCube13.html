//The archemedian spiral are formed when a point moves uniformly along a radius AND a constant angular velocity.
//so if I increase the amplitude uniformly AND theta uniformly, I should create an archemedian spiral.
//what about this? cube.position.x = 10*i*Math.cos(i); cube.position.y = 10*i*Math.sin(i);
//I have the radius increasing by 50, and the angle increasing by 1. 
//I get this twisted starfish thing...maybe it's because polar vs cartesian require different things. 
//can I translate r to ampl? Yes but I realize, that because in the formula a and b can be 0 and 1 respectivly 
//it doesn't make a difference. SO I tried scaling it to 2*Math.PI and got PART of a spiral curve, so I went *4 on
//the denominator and got a pretty good ArcheSpiral I think...Also increased the cubenum to 100. 
//cube.position.x = 10*i*Math.cos(2*Math.PI*i/cubenum*4); cube.position.y = 10*i*Math.sin(2*Math.PI*i/cubenum*4); 
//success! So it seems part of the issue was scaling it to some multiple of 2*PI. I just thought that should
//work based on the example on http://www.mathematische-basteleien.de/spiral.htm that uses that unit circle thing
//in the first examples and the idea that if it's uniform angular vel then what could be more uniform that a factor of 2*PI...
//also I think I was assuming that i++ when put into the cos/sin functions would come out as uniform but actually I 
//think that at least they wont be the same angles  as the thing loops. If it goes 40deg then 50 deg then 70 deg then 100 deg
//then it's not uniform...I think I need to look into sin and cos more...
//Basics!
